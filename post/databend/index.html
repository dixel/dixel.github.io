<p>Over the Christmas silent period, I got my hands on <a href="https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend">Databend</a>, a data warehousing solution intended to provide an easily scalable, cloud-first, SQL-based data engine. The keywords bingo speaks for itself: it&rsquo;s written in Rust, friendly with containers/Kubernetes (k8s), elastically scalable, and uses Raft as a consensus algorithm instead of Paxos. In short, it fits all the last five years&rsquo; fashion trends in data warehousing. What specifically appealed to me was the ability to use cloud object storage as a storage backend and the isolation between compute and storage. Benchmarks comparing its performance with alternative open-source solutions <a href="https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/">ClickBench</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@databend/tpc-h-benchmark-databend-cloud-vs-snowflake-aa97971c32a0">with cloud alternatives</a> show some interesting results.</p>
<p>I briefly went through the documentation to figure out how to try things out - and, of course, there was a tutorial on how to set it up locally with MinIO or locally with Docker. I didn&rsquo;t even try this because what I would get locally in that case would only be a loosely implemented SQL dialect, whereas I needed the power of distributed computation at my fingertips. So, I went with the K8S setup, even though, having only a handful of microservices in the current organization, we don&rsquo;t use it in production. It took me no time to discover a great way to provision and control a k8s cluster on AWS without the need for Terraform - <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a>. After some dancing with the documentation and setting up the <a href="https://docs.databend.com/guides/deploy/cluster/deploying-databend-on-kubernetes">recommended helm charts and applications</a> (beware, &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; in this guide is almost always mandatory - and even if not, you surely want to monitor your cluster after setting it up).</p>
<p>I decided to use a few smaller on-demand nodes for databend-meta nodes and a node group with spot instances having more beef in terms of networking/memory/CPU (in that order), with the ability to interchange things in the future. After some tuning, I was able to find a setup that was giving enough performance without breaking the bank and managed to reproduce some production queries we use with AWS Redshift.</p>
<p>Getting this result on the client was already quite pleasant, where I thought it&rsquo;s about to start working as intended:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>34 rows read in 73.337 sec. Processed 753.26 million rows, 100.63 GiB (10.27 million rows/s, 1.37 GiB/s)
</code></pre><p>Though it might seem not much for modern bandwidth, for a medium-complexity analytics query, that demonstrated some potential to me.</p>
<p>A nice thing for integration - a native JDBC driver was available, together with the ability to connect through a MySQL interface, which easily allowed integrating and trying out a few existing data tools.</p>
<p>Overall, I am pretty happy with the setup. Key benefits that I noted for myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> It is so far super-good-enough for our main use-cases.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation:</strong> The engine is mainly performing/optimizing analytical queries; the data is stored elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> The tool provides very good interfacing with the outside world without jeopardizing the consistency of the tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key things I&rsquo;ll keep in mind before going full speed with the solution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maturity/Stability:</strong> The tool is quite young, and some of the behaviors I observed proved it:
<ul>
<li>User-space queries causing cluster shutdown.</li>
<li>Sometimes misleading error messages, especially depending on the connector/driver used.</li>
<li>The UDF library is not as extended as for more well-established tools on the market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, this leads me to think I will keep the tool on the radar and explore possibilities of using it for non-critical use cases, where performance prevails over stability and accuracy. I also started using it more for ad-hoc data analysis (loading a file from S3, performing an analysis, and loading it back). For those tiny purposes, the tool is great, and I think this is the best way to gain more traction. Wishing the team great success with the development.</p>
