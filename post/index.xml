      <description>OpenAPI specification drills it&amp;rsquo;s ways into becoming a standard in many software companies. Let&amp;rsquo;s say your organization wants to follow the API-first approach. It means that before implementing any cross-team (or 3d party integration) functionality, the parties first agree on the contract, and review it.
I had this approach in mind since I&amp;rsquo;ve started working in a small payment provider company. Contracts there meant everything, and negotiating the API/authentication process was basically 80% of the job.</description>
