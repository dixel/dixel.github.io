      <title>Databend on AWS/EKS</title>

      <description>Over the Christmas silent period, I got my hands on Databend, a data warehousing solution intended to provide an easily scalable, cloud-first, SQL-based data engine. The keywords bingo speaks for itself: it&amp;rsquo;s written in Rust, friendly with containers/Kubernetes (k8s), elastically scalable, and uses Raft as a consensus algorithm instead of Paxos. In short, it fits all the last five years&amp;rsquo; fashion trends in data warehousing. What specifically appealed to me was the ability to use cloud object storage as a storage backend and the isolation between compute and storage.</description>

      <title>Flipper Zero for testing old dusty electronic components</title>

      <description>Dimmable LED On high frequencies (&amp;gt; 50 Hz), blinking of a LED becomes undistinguishable from a bright light. By using pulse width, the &amp;ldquo;brightness&amp;rdquo;, or it&amp;rsquo;s perception can be controlled.
Servo When I first encountered this device servo, I got really confused, as the way it actually moves towards a certain angle is rather cumbersome. For this specific servo (the one I got with my ARDX) the following settings allowed me to control 180 degrees of angle with a step of 9 degrees:</description>

      <description>Last saturday I visited my second ClojureD conference in Berlin. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing experience meeting people who indirectly influenced my choice of programming language for the past several years (kudos to Alexander and Nikita).
It&amp;rsquo;s also very pleasant to see how many new things popped up recently in Clojure community.
Here are few highlights I wanted to share:
Babashka by @borkdude (github) Really appreciate how much effort Michael puts into the modern tooling for Clojure!</description>

      <title>Querying the databases from REPL</title>
      <link>https://www.changes.md/post/2019-12-14-jdbc-next/</link>

      <description>For already quite some time I prefer using Clojure REPL instead of any other tools for querying the databases. At work we have variety of the storage solutions available (Postgres, Aurora, Presto, Hive), and having a single consistent SQL read-only API to them is crucial for productivity. Additional benefit compared to the graphical tools available in the market is the ability of programmatic post-processing of the data using higher-level language. Being very data-oriented, Clojure comes really handy.</description>

      <title>Mastering the Tooling around Clojure Data Analysis</title>

      <description>My December present to myself was a series of books. One of them was called &amp;ldquo;Mastering Clojure Data Analysis&amp;rdquo; by Eric Rochester. It contains a comprehensive set of examples on analysing and visualising data using Clojure. I found it quite interesting mainly because a couple of use-cases covered in the book correllated very well with daily work, so I thought &amp;ldquo;why not?&amp;rdquo;. Once I got the book, I realised what&amp;rsquo;d be the biggest challenge.</description>

      <title>Complicated data-driven applications</title>

      <description>Any design is not perfect. There needs to be a way to evolve away from any decision. Components have different lifecycles. Components have different levels of criticality. Those components should have a very clean interface between each other and an outstanding level of isolation. Replaceable &amp;gt; Extendable, because the latter is more opinionated. The lifetime of the components should be challenged at all times. Proven technologies should be maintained in a conservative way.</description>

      <title>Simple data-driven applications in Clojure</title>

      <description>Sometimes the information from the data lake/warehouse/pond/whatever simply needs to be exposed via the REST-api. Just getting the tooling right sometimes may be troublesome. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example on how things can work out in clojure.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have an SQL-based engine like Presto (or Presto) as the main interface to the datalake. Let&amp;rsquo;s check how we can leverage the power of Clojure to build a simple application for fetching the data from Presto.</description>

      <title>3 libraries to work with swagger in Clojure</title>

      <description>OpenAPI specification drills it&amp;rsquo;s ways into becoming a standard in many software companies. Let&amp;rsquo;s say your organization wants to follow the API-first approach. It means that before implementing any cross-team (or 3d party integration) functionality, the parties first agree on the contract, and review it.
I had this approach in mind since I&amp;rsquo;ve started working in a small payment provider company. Contracts there meant everything, and negotiating the API/authentication process was basically 80% of the job.</description>
